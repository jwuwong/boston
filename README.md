# The phonetic correlates of Singlish

This repository contains related materials for a study investigating the phonetic correlates of Singlish.

This study is the first part of a larger project aimed at exploring the sociophonetic correlates of Singlish, a colloquial variety of English that is used in Singapore. Specifically, we conducted a perception experiment by using an online speeded forced-choice task in order to investigate how listeners categorized dialectal variability in Singlish and what prosodic features were used to do so.

This repository contains the experiment code, data, and analyses for this experiment.

The repository for the second part of this project, which involves an attribute rating task, can be found at https://github.com/yinlintan/social-singlish.
