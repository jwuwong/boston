# The phonetic correlates of Singlish

This repository contains related materials for a study investigating the phonetic correlates of Singlish.

Specifically, this study is the first part of a larger project aimed at exploring the sociophonetic correlates of Singlish, a colloquial variety of English that is used in Singapore. We use a bottom-up, experimental approach to investigate this research question. The repository for the second part of this project, which involves an attribute rating task, can be found at https://github.com/yinlintan/social-singlish.
