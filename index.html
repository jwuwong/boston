    You have now completed the two practice trials.

    In this experiment, you will listen to a variety of spoken sentences and phrases. 

    Like with the practice trial, you will listen to two audio clips at a time. Your task is to decide which clip of the two sounds more Singlish.

    Some audio clips might sound similar to one another. Please do your best to respond as quickly as possible.
